# PTF-Manager
## A simple portfolio manager with basics features :
- Portfolio tracking over time
- Unrealised & realised PL calculation

## How does it work ?
- Step 1 : create your own "Transaction BD.xlsx" file. You should keep the same columns' names.
- Step 2 : create your own "tickers" dictionnaries depending on the securities you have in the portfolio to match yahoo finance's tickers names.
- Step 3 : the app will use yahoo's financial api to get historical data.
- Step 4 : Visualizations are embedded into a dash app.
- Extra : a light version of the app can be deployed to heroku using the generated csv files.

## What comes next ?
- More visualizations to gain insights on the history of transactions
